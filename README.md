### No scientist is an island
**Description**: Scientists often create data derivatives (i.e., transforming, combining, and/or altering raw variables in some way) when cleaning data and preparing for analyses. Unfortunately, these derivatives are often generated within larger scripts, are the result of judgement calls that aren't written down (e.g., deriving a new variable for a subset of the entire sample), can be duplicated when team members aren't aware that the work has already been done by someone else, and can be lost when team members move on to other projects, graduate, and/or leave the group for their next positions. The goal of this project is to develop a workflow for how teams can efficiently and transparently create, document, and share data derivatives with their future selves, their team members, and their collaborators through the creation and maintenance of a **derived data registry**.   \

### BIDSInspec
**Description**: BIDSInspec is a python library that will help researchers summarize, visualize, and validate their BIDS datasets. With the increasing use of automated tools (e.g., BIDS apps) it is important to always examine your data prior to pre-processing. A problem that arises when curating neuroimaging data is the heterogeneity that exisits in MRI session aquisitions within and across institutions. BIDSInspec is designed to solve these problems by: 1. creating a summary report of the BIDS directory by specific features (e.g., scanner type, magnetic field stength, acquisition time, resolution, etc.) and 2. enabling researchers to validate a BIDS dataset against an acquisition protocol using features within JSON sidecar files and NIFTI image properties (e.g., image shape, resolution, etc.)\

### Nipoppy-EffeX
**Description**: Nipoppy-effeX addresses the challenge of underpowered functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, which often rely on limited sample sizes and custom preprocessing pipelines. Our project proposes a portable, user-friendly BIDS application that facilitates the reprocessing of both public and non-public fMRI datasets. Currently, Nipoppy-effeX enables researchers to execute semi-automated, reproducible data processing pipelines solely for resting-state functional connectivity analyses. By leveraging the lightweight Nipoppy framework and robust tools like fMRIPrep, users can perform within-subject and between-group analyses efficiently. Future enhancements include extending the applicationâ€™s capabilities to support task-based fMRI analyses and enabling users to transmit results to a central server, further enriching the landscape of fMRI research. By democratizing access to comprehensive fMRI analysis, Nipoppy-effeX paves the way for more powerful and statistically sound neuroimaging studies while complementing existing databases like BrainEffeX. \

### Federated Learning 
**Description**: Federated learning (FL) has become a promising machine learning method for conducting large-scale analyses across multiple institutions without the need to share data. With FL, data privacy and security are maintained, as the data never leave the institution; only encrypted model parameters are exchanged and aggregated. The aim of our project was to explore the use of FL using Flower (open source federated learning framework) and scikit-learn to predict brain age using measures of grey and white matter volume. We first focus on collating FreeSurfer statistical data across multiple subjects, focusing on both cortical and subcortical brain regions from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN). We included 223 participants with demographic information and freesurfer deriviates available. Our script (client_newmodel.py) sets up a client for federated learning using the Flower (see https://flower.ai/docs/framework/tutorial-series-what-is-federated-learning.html for more details). It enables training and evaluation of machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, LassoCV) on different partitions of the HBN sample. The client communicates with a federated learning server to participate in model training and evaluation of tasks over multiple rounds of federated learning, and saves the aggregated model weights after each round. We use 3 to mimic different dataset and compare accuracy in models with different sample distributions.
