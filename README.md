### No scientist is an island
**Description**: Scientists often create data derivatives (i.e., transforming, combining, and/or altering raw variables in some way) when cleaning data and preparing for analyses. Unfortunately, these derivatives are often generated within larger scripts, are the result of judgement calls that aren't written down (e.g., deriving a new variable for a subset of the entire sample), can be duplicated when team members aren't aware that the work has already been done by someone else, and can be lost when team members move on to other projects, graduate, and/or leave the group for their next positions. The goal of this project is to develop a workflow for how teams can efficiently and transparently create, document, and share data derivatives with their future selves, their team members, and their collaborators through the creation and maintenance of a **derived data registry**.   \
